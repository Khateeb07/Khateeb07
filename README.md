## Hello, I'm Khateeb Aamir Usmani!👋

🎓 I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at **Integral University, Lucknow**. I have a strong grasp of **C** and **Java**, and a passion for building efficient, real-world software.

💻 I enjoy solving problems on platforms like **LeetCode** and continuously exploring core computer science concepts to sharpen my skills.

🌐 I'm familiar with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, giving me a solid foundation in front-end web development.

🎤 Outside of tech, I occasionally anchor university events — an experience that’s helped me grow my **confidence and communication** skills.
